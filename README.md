# TREEHOUSE-Project-3-online-registration-form

##Project Instructions

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question in the community.

* For this project we will be checking the design in Google Chrome version 48 or higher.
* Use the supplied mockup files to build a mobile-ready registration form.
* Use a mobile-first approach: make sure the basic design (without media queries) matches the mobile design in the mobile-form.png.
  * Make sure the HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document, see the project resources for links to "Using the viewport meta tag" and "Configuring the Viewport".
* Use CSS media queries to change the layout of the form at screen widths of 760 pixels or wider, to match the desktop design in the desktop-form.png file.
* Make sure you include the following form field types:
 * text input
 * email input
 * telephone input
 * select menu
 * checkboxes
 * radio buttons
 * textfield
 * submit button
* Use descriptive names for the form inputs -- for example, "email" for the email field, not "e" or "xyz."
* Add labels to the form fields using the HTML <label> tag
* Use the input field's placeholder attribute to add "required" to
  * the Full Name field
  * the Email address field
* Make sure you properly pair <label> elements with form controls via the for attribute.
* Add "focus" states to the form for when a user clicks or tabs into a text field.
* Add two fieldsets and legends for the
  * "Contact Information" section of the page, and
  * The "Newsletter" section of the page.
Note: You don't need to make a functioning form -- that is, it doesn't have to do anything when the form is submitted. To do that, you'd need to add some server-side programming to actually process the user's input.
* Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.
  * Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
  * There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:
    * Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
    * If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
    * If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.
